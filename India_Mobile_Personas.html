      						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
                  <p>
As apart of the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/New_Readers" target="_blank">New Readers</a> initiative, this research studies the common habits, needs, and behaviors of new Wikipedia readers in countries with developing internet access who may have limited to no awareness of Wikimedia sites. This research is used to develop Personas, a tool that enables teams to assess and develop potential product, partnership, messaging, and community actions to grow reach and participation in Wikimedia projects.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                 <p>
India is a country with a lot of diverse mobile phones users. At one end there is a power user, who lives in a metropolitan city, with access to technology and is proficient in English to be able to access information and leverage technology. At the other end of the spectrum we have users who are technologically less privileged and who use only regional languages for technology. This study was conducted to understand all these users who are using Wikipedia, their motivations, usage and challenges.                 </p>


  <p>
  <h2>Research Goals</h2>

<li>Get an up-to-date understanding of who Wikipedia users are and what motivates them to use Wikipedia on their phones</li>
<li>Identify audience segments relevant to users of Wikipedia on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Understand the significance of various dimensions of a user (e.g. differences by life stage, cultural factors), usage (e.g. motivations, patterns and/or critical features), entry point (e.g. native apps, mobile web, channel apps) and conceptual understanding (e.g. consuming vs. contributing, content confidence flags)</li>
<li>Identify challenges and wish lists of these users </li>
</p>


<p>
<h2>Research Questions</h2>
<li>What is the users understanding of consumption vs contribution? </li>
<li>Do users trust Wikipedia?</li>
<li>What are the challenges in consuming Wikipedia? </li>
<li>What are the challenges in contributing to Wikipedia? </li>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
Wikimedia Foundation worked in partnership with <a href="https://hureo.com/" target="_blank">Hureo</a>, a user research company based in Pune, India. Hureo identified participants for the study in 5 cities across different geographical regions in India, covering various cities from Tiers 1, 2, 3 and rural areas. In each location, Hureo conducted one-on-one, in-depth, and in-person sessions. The duration of each session was about 45 to 60 minutes. In the first 30-45 minutes, participants were interviewed about their phone usage, internet usage, content requirements, Wikipedia usage, challenges and wish list. After this interview, the participants were asked to show their Wikipedia usage on their devices through a series of tasks.

<h2>Outcomes & Findings</h2>
<p>
<i>Who is a Wikipedia user? </i>
<li>A Wikipedia user is a student, a mother, a volunteer, a working professional, who is searching for information on an Android mobile device. They use Wikipedia to search for information for various purposes such university assignments, their children’s homework, to find specific information to support their arguments, for work related research, and for general knowledge. Users learned about Wikipedia from various sources - in college through their friends or professor, through their children’s school, at work, or from Google searches. Most of the users access Wikipedia through a Google search on their mobile browser and go directly to the browser and very few go to the Wikipedia app.
</li>
<li>On Wikipedia, users read articles, follow the hyperlinks to get more in-depth knowledge about topics, and sometimes share articles via WhatsApp. Users appreciate that Wikipedia has a vast amount of information and that each article is systematically categorized, making it easy to read and find specific content. </li>

</p>
<p>
<i>What is the users understanding of consumption vs contribution? </i>
<li>Wikipedia has both kind of users who are consuming content without contribution, and who have low awareness of contribution and Wikipedia’s policies. They are not aware of how Wikipedia content is created or who is creating it. There is also another group who understand how Wikipedia creates content but does not find motivation or time to contribute.</li>
<li>Wikipedia contributors are students, volunteers, and working professionals who learned about contribution through their friends or peers, volunteering activities, college professors, and the community. They are motivated to contribute to Wikipedia to update incorrect or missing content, both in English and regional language Wikipedia. Novice editors have some understanding of Wikipedia’s policies whereas power editors have a deep understanding and conduct sessions to enable other contributors learn about policies and contribution. Power contributors work on the ground level, building a team of editors and holding workshops to enable people to become contributors. </li>
</p>
<p>
<i>Do the users trust Wikipedia? </i>
<li>Among Wikipedia users, the trust in Wikipedia varies. One group trusts Wikipedia and finds it reliable due to Wikipedia’s strong policies and community-driven moderation. The other group reads Wikipedia but is unaware of Wikipedia’s contribution policies and finds the content to be unreliable due to missing citations and incomplete or inaccurate content.</li>
</p>
<p>
<i>What are the challenges in consuming Wikipedia? </i>
<li>Wikipedia users are unable to use Wikipedia for academic assignments due to missing citation and the lack of trust from the university authorities in the content. Regional Wikipedia consumers struggle with a lack of regional content for education, general knowledge, entertainment, etc.</li>
</p>
<p>
<i>What are the challenges in contributing to Wikipedia? </i>
<li>There is a lack of awareness about contributing to Wikipedia and the contribution policies. Contributors struggle with the mobile UI - contributors use the mobile only to make small edits and prefer to use a larger screen of laptop to make bigger edits. </li>
