      						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
                  <p>
The United States Mobile Personas focuses on readers and contributors who primarily use mobile devices to access Wikipedia. First we examined user assumptions, behaviors, interactions and reactions to the various modes of interactions that users can have with Wikipedia on mobile. Then we developed Personas that we use to guide product and service development that best supports the average mobile user. 							   </p>
                 <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                 <p>
                   The Wikipedia Reading Team was interested in gaining insights regarding user behaviors specific to the mobile use of Wikipedia.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   Personas implore teams to understand that there is no way to create a site or product for everyone. When teams focus their efforts to targeted audiences, they’re more likely to have a stronger impact towards overall usability. Personas help define the audience for product development and they force teams to spend time thinking about which types of users are critical to the business and how changes deter or attract them.
</p>


  <p>
  <h2>Research Goals</h2>

<li>Identify audience segments relevant to users of Wikipedia on mobile devices. </li>
<li>Understand the significance of various dimensions of user (e.g. differences by lifestage, cultural factors), usage (e.g. motivations, patterns and/or critical features), entrypoint (e.g. native apps, mobile web, channel apps) and conceptual understanding (e.g. consuming vs. contributing, content confidence flags). </li>
<li>To infuse the research effort with subject matter expertise by involving WMF. </li>
</p>


<p>
<h2>Research Questions</h2>
<li>How are people accessing and using information for learning online?</li>
<li>What kind of technology (hardware and software) are people using to learn with?</li>
<li>What kind of access do people have to the internet? (frequency / speed)</li>
<li>What information is most valued?</li>
<li>What information is most difficult to access?</li>
<li>What do people search for but can not find or have difficulty finding?</li>
<li>What’s impact of having access to more information?  (might be hard to answer this one)</li>
<li>What differences between social groups are there – male/female, age, wealth etc when it comes to learning?</li>
<li>Do people use Wikipedia for learning? If so, in what context, and for what reasons?</li>
<li>How aware are people of the Wikipedia brand and what sits behind it?</li>
<li>If people are aware of Wikipedia, why do they use it ? Why don’t they use it?</li>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
Our method is contextual inquiry through in-depth user interviews. <a href="http://logicdept.com/" target="_blank">Logic Department</a> conducted 24 interviews with mobile users that were identified as either readers or editors. Interviews lasted between 30-45 minutes each. Themes were extracted from the interviews and data excerpts were categorized by affinity diagram.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Outcomes & Findings</h2>
<p>
<i>Downloading the App</i>
<li>iPhone users tended to be unaware of the existence of an app, or needed a compelling reason to download apps, and were very aware of memory space on their phones.</li>
</p>
<p>
<i>Usage</i>
<li>iPhone owners were very quick information viewers, often using Wikipedia while in transit, and mentioned scanning articles “in the moment”.</li>
<li>Android users mentioned that they use Wikipedia to aid in their daily work in order to look up technical information or research. They were more likely to download the app than iPhone users.</li>
</p>
<p>
<i>Features</i>
<li>Overall, participants would like more organization with a “cleaner” interface that’s more visually appealing.</li>
<li>Existing features that people felt were critical to keep in Wikipedia were sources (making sure those links work), the ability to quickly move through article topics, bookmarking or saving for later, robust search (with a clear disambiguation page), and an article preview.</li>
<li>There were lots of awareness issues, as many participants requested features that already exist.</li>
<li>Some customizations that were requested that do not currently exist: Google Assistant integration, the ability to select the font (request of a visually impaired user), and a better way to view the browsing history.</li>
</p>
<p>
<i>Editing</i>
<li>Across participants, there was a perception that editing has changed throughout the years and has been well-established.</li>
<li>Generally, participants feel that Wikipedia provides unbiased information, assume editors are volunteers, and think there are different types/levels of editors.</li>
<li>Many participants did have a fear of editing and the majority had not done it before, or had and then seen their edits quickly deleted or rejected.</li>
<li>When asked for reasons why they didn’t contribute, many mentioned lacking the confidence that they would have enough knowledge or sources to back up their content.</li>
<li>iPhone users were aware of editing but had a low awareness of how it’s done. These users would be most likely to edit on their phones if they were prompted to answer questions, to correct minor grammar or typos, or to check sources.</li>
<li>Android users were also unlikely to edit on a phone because the interface was too confusing (markup is too complicated), their keyboard is too small, and they don’t have the ability to save drafts of edits.</li>
</p>
<p>
<i>Trust</i>
<li>For participants, there were varying levels of trust in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Those that had high trust in content said that citations and sources were key to their trust.</li>
<li>When distrust of Wikipedia content did come up, it was often in relation to articles that were short, news articles, and articles relating to politics or political figures.</li>
