					<p>
						Design researchers at Wikimedia Foundation seek to understand the needs, motivations, goals and challenges of people who consume and/or contribute to free knowledge. We work to understand how individuals use technology to interact with Wikimedia projects, and other sites. Our work contributes to the work of Wikimedia communities as well as teams across the Wikimedia Foundation. Our goal is creating meaningful positive experiences for the millions of readers and contributors who use Wikipedia and its sister projects every day.

						<h2>What is Design Strategy?</h2>
						<p>
						“Design research is foundational to creating products, services, and systems that respond to human needs...research specifically undertaken to support the strategic design and development of products, services, and programs.” -Reboot
						</p>

						<p>
						At the most basic level, setting direction requires an understanding of two things: Data and Humans.
						What we do as strategiests is look at a full spectrum of inputs to the product design process, from empirical data, to understanding how humans experience what we’ve made.
						This spectrum includes activities that are aimed at explaining things we observe in human behavior or in the data.
						</p>


						<p>
						And somewhere in the middle, between explanation and experiment, are exploratory activities.
						</p>

						It requires a lot of collaboration between disciplines: research, design, analytics, communications. We observe how people use technology to interact with Wikimedia projects and access and contribute to free knowledge, and talk with them about their experiences. In partnership with our research participants, we generate rich data in the form of interviews, surveys, usability studies, and field notes.
						</p>
						<p>
						We perform both evaluative and generative design research. There is not a clean cut line between these types of research, and we often do both for a project.
						<p>
						Generative research (for example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry" target="_blank">contextual inquiry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_interview" target="_blank">unstructured interviews</a>) provides a better understanding of needs, goals, challenges, constraints, contexts, and motivations of people who want to or do access and potentially contribute to free knowledge. are generated from this work are more likely to succeed because they are informed and created from understanding the people (and their technology) who will use them, their needs, contexts, constraints, etc. Generative research is many times done at the beginning of a product development cycle, to inform the project's direction.
						</p>
						<p>
						Evaluative research (for example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing" target="_blank">usability testing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_testing" target="_blank">concept testing</a>) is an important set of methods the team employs to evaluate concepts, prototypes and current functionality with users. Testing functionality and ideas with the users we are building them for, ensures that functionality is usable and useful for the people they are being designed and built for. Evaluative research is done within product development cycles in close collaboration with product development teams. Evaluative research generally is faster, and requires less participants than generative research.

						<p>
						WMF teams use the research findings to decide what they should build, for whom, why it is needed, and how to build it.
						This research informs the needs of people we design and build with and for, and can be used to iterate design and technological solutions to be intuitive, useful, usable, and fit within (and not break) users' workflows.
