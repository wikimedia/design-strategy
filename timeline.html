					<p><h2>2019</h2></p>
					<p></p>
					<span class="project__card--desc">In 2019 our focus was on understanding the potentials and pitfalls
						of small but essential contributions (e.g. spelling corrections, image captioning, tagging,
						section translation, etc.),
						especially from mobile devices. We also did a deep dive to understand the spectrum of
						contributors that fuel and enable the Wikimedia projects. And, we began to evaluate the user
						experience of machine
						augmented content.
